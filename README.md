# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions – Explained & Commented

Welcome! 👋 This repository contains my personal solutions to selected [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, with **clear comments** and **simple explanations** to help others (and myself) understand the logic behind each approach.

Note: I also added some algorithms suggested by ChatGPT along with the ones from leetCode. They're found at the "GPT.md" file.

Whether you're just getting started or reviewing key problem patterns, feel free to explore and learn along!

## 📌 What's Included

- ✅ Solved problems in Java and TypeScript
- ✍️ Well-commented code to explain the thought process
- 🔁 Common patterns like: Stack, Two Pointers, Hash Map, Brute Force, etc.
- 🧪 Test cases for most solutions

## :blue_square: TS

To run TypeScript files in VSCode, you'll need to install the dependencies of the TS package of this repo, and run a custom command:

To install dependencies: (must have `node` and `npm` installed. TypeScript is installed as a global dependency)
```
cd TS
npm install
npm install -g typescript
```

To run a .ts file (you need to be on TS folder, if you're not, run `cd TS`):
```
npm run runTS <filename>
```
Simply change `<filename>` for the name of the file you want to run. If the file is called "invertString.ts", for example:
```
npm run runTS invertString.ts
```

## 🧱 Folder Structure

Folders are organized by language. The main folders of this repo are "Java" and "TS". The "TS" folder contains an `npm` package. 

## 💡 Why I Made This

Explaining code makes you a better developer. By commenting my solutions, I’m practicing communication and reinforcing my own understanding — and hopefully helping others along the way.
