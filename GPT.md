## ðŸ”¤ String Exercises
**Text Cleaner** âœ…
Remove punctuation, extra spaces, and convert a string to lowercase.

**Word Frequency Counter** âœ…
Count how often each word appears in a paragraph using a `Map<String, Integer>`.

**Anagram Groups** âœ…
Group words that are anagrams of each other (e.g., `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"] â†’ [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]`).

**Find First Non-Repeated Character** âœ…
Return the first character in a string that does not repeat.

**Palindrome Normalizer** âœ…
Check if a string is a palindrome ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.

**String Compressor** âœ…
Input: `"aaabbbcc"` â†’ Output: `"a3b3c2"`

**CamelCase to Snake_Case Converter** âœ…
Convert `"camelCaseString"` to `"camel_case_string"`.

**Letter Histogram** âœ…
Print a histogram (like a bar chart in text) showing how often each letter appears in a string.

## ðŸ”¢ Array Exercises
**Remove Duplicates from Array (without Set)** âœ…
Return a new array with duplicates removed, but maintain order.

**Find All Pairs That Sum to Target** âœ…
Given an `int[]`, return all pairs of numbers that sum up to a target.

**Majority Element** âœ…
Return the element that appears more than `n/2` times, or say "none".

**Sliding Window Maximum**
From a large array, find the maximum value in every window of size `k`.

**Rotate Array**
Shift the array to the right by k positions. Example: `[1,2,3,4,5]` â†’ `[4,5,1,2,3]`.

**Chunked Array Split**
Split an array into chunks of size n.
Example: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` â†’ `[[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]` for size 2.

**Merge Two Sorted Arrays**
Combine two sorted arrays into a single sorted array (without duplicates).

## ðŸ”‘ HashMap Exercises
**Find Duplicates in Array** âœ…
Use a `HashMap` to find which values appear more than once.

**Two Sum (Alternative Versions)**
Return value pairs, not indexes.

**First Repeated Word in a String**
Return the first word that appears more than once in a sentence.

**Group Words by First Letter**
Input: `["apple", "ant", "banana", "bob"]`
Output: `{ a: ["apple", "ant"], b: ["banana", "bob"] }`

**Phone Book Implementation**
A mini app where names map to phone numbers (`Map<String, List<String>>`).

**Inventory Tracker**
Use a `Map<String, Integer>` to track items being added/removed from inventory.

**Character Count Comparator**
Given two strings, check if one string can be constructed using the characters (and quantities) of another â€” similar to the ransom note problem, but more flexible.
